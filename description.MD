<h1> Davids Neural-Connect-Four </h1>

This project is a Four Wins programme that uses a reinforcement learning bot from my bachelor thesis. The website runs completely in the frontend.

The website is powered by a Node.js server. Tensorflow.js is used to execute the neural network in the frontend.
